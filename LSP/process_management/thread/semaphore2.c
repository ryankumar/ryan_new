/* Letâ€™s modify the program slightly to semaphore1.c to pretend that text input from the keyboard is sometimes replaced with automatically
available text. Modify the reading loop in the main to this:

 Now if you type FAST, the program calls sem_post to allow the character counter to run, but immedi-
ately updates work_area with something different.
 
 The problem is that the program was relying on text input from the program taking so long that there
was time for the other thread to count the words before the main thread was ever ready to give it more
words to count. When you tried to give it two different sets of words to count in quick succession (FAST
from the keyboard and then Wheeee... automatically), there was no time for the second thread to exe-
cute. However, the semaphore had been incremented more than once, so the counter thread just kept
counting the words and decreasing the semaphore until it became zero again.
