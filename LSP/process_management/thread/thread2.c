/* This program creates a single extra thread, shows that it is sharing variables with the original thread,
and gets the new thread to return a result to the original thread. Multithreaded programs donâ€™t get much
simpler than this! Here is thread1.c :
 
 here after blocking of thread1 thread2 is not started ,it is in sleep mode for 3sec and the process is not working simultaneously...hence to run simultaneously both thread refere thread3.c
