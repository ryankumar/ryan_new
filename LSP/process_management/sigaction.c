/*Make the changes that follow so that SIGINT is intercepted by sigaction . Call the new programm ctrlc2.c . */
/* How It Works
The program calls sigaction instead of signal to set the signal handler for Ctrl+C ( SIGINT ) to the
function ouch . It first has to set up a sigaction structure that contains the handler, a signal mask, and
flags. In this case, you donâ€™t need any flags, and an empty signal mask is created with the new function,
sigemptyset .
After running this program, you may find a core dump (in a file called core ) has been created. You can
safely delete it.

/*
When you run this version of the program, you always get a message when you type Ctrl+C because
SIGINT is handled repeatedly by sigaction . To terminate the program, you have to type Ctrl+\, which
generates the SIGQUIT signal by default.
