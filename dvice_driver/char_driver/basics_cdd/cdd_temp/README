first excute the app.c : gcc app.c
			$ ./a.out
here you will get to see that fd=-1,count=-1 and count=-1
bcz in /dev there is no Mychar file. hence execute the char.c by following methods

1st step: make (makfile)
2nd step:sudo insmod char.ko
3rd step:check device file is loaded or not according tp major number ($cat /proc/devices )
4th step: execute $gcc app.c and open another terminal $sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
5th step: ./a.out
here you will get outpit as fd=3,count=2,count=0 as file is loaded and observe another terminal also
